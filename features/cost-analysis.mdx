title: Cost Analysis
description: "Understand your Elasticsearch costs with index-level visibility"
---

## Overview

Shardly's cost analysis goes beyond what Elastic Cloud provides. While Elastic shows you total deployment costs, Shardly breaks these down to the **index level**, giving you visibility into exactly where your money is going.

</Frame>

<Tip>
**Key differentiator:** Elastic Cloud only shows deployment-level costs. Shardly shows you which *specific indices* are expensive so you know exactly where to optimize.
</Tip>

## Cost dashboard

The main dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of your Elasticsearch spending:

### Summary metrics

<CardGroup cols={4}>
<Card title="Total monthly spend" icon="dollar-sign">
Current month's projected costs based on daily usage
</Card>

<Card title="Month-over-month" icon="chart-line">
Percentage change from last month with trend direction
</Card>

<Card title="Potential savings" icon="piggy-bank">
Sum of all pending recommendation estimated savings
</Card>

<Card title="Active recommendations" icon="lightbulb">
Number of optimization opportunities available
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Cost trend chart

Visualize your spending over time with interactive charts:

- **Default 30-day view** with daily granularity
- **Toggle timeframes**: 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 12 months
- **Cost breakdown**: Capacity, storage, data transfer
- **Anomaly detection**: Automatic highlighting of unusual spikes
- **Hover details**: See exact costs for any day

### Cost by storage tier

Pie chart visualization of spending distribution across Elasticsearch tiers:

| Tier | Cost Factor | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Hot** | 1.0x (most expensive) | Active data, frequent queries, real-time |
| **Warm** | 0.5x (50% cheaper) | Recent data, less frequent access |
| **Cold** | 0.25x (75% cheaper) | Infrequent access, compressed storage |
| **Frozen** | 0.1x (90% cheaper) | Archive, searchable snapshots only |

<Tip>
Moving 1TB from hot to warm tier saves ~$50/month. Hot to cold saves ~$75/month!
</Tip>

## Index-level cost breakdown

Drill down to see costs for individual indices - the level of detail Elastic Cloud doesn't provide:

### Index cost table

```
Index Pattern      | Size    | Tier | Monthly Cost | Trend
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
logs-prod-*        | 2.5 TB  | Hot  | $3,200       | ↑ +12.5%
metrics-*          | 1.8 TB  | Hot  | $2,400       | ↓ -5.2%
traces-*           | 950 GB  | Warm | $850         | ↑ +8.1%
audit-logs-*       | 750 GB  | Warm | $680         | ↑ +2.3%
security-*         | 500 GB  | Hot  | $650         | ↓ -1.5%
```

### Powerful filtering and sorting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Filter by tier" icon="filter">
Focus on hot, warm, cold, or frozen tier indices to identify tier optimization opportunities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Filter by team" icon="users">
Show only indices attributed to specific teams based on your attribution rules.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Search by pattern" icon="magnifying-glass">
Find specific indices by name pattern (e.g., `logs-prod-*` or `metrics-api-*`).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Filter by cost threshold" icon="dollar-sign">
Show only indices above or below specific cost thresholds (e.g., >$100/month).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Sort options:**
- **Cost** (highest first) - Find your most expensive indices
- **Size** (largest first) - Identify storage-heavy indices
- **Growth rate** (fastest growing) - Catch cost increases early
- **Shard count** - Find over-sharded indices

## Cost attribution by team

See costs broken down by team or project using attribution rules:

### Setting up attribution rules

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to cost rules">
Go to **Settings** → **Cost Rules** in the sidebar.
</Step>

<Step title="Create attribution rule">
Click **Add Rule** and configure:

- **Pattern**: Index name pattern (e.g., `logs-frontend-*`)
- **Pattern Type**: Prefix, suffix, regex, or exact match
- **Team**: Team name (e.g., "Frontend Engineering")
- **Project**: Optional project name (e.g., "Web Application")
- **Priority**: Lower numbers evaluated first

<Info>
Rules are evaluated in priority order. The first matching rule wins.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Test and save">
Use the **Test Pattern** feature to verify your rule matches the intended indices, then save.

<Check>
Rule successfully matches expected indices
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Team cost view

Once attribution rules are configured, you'll see spending by team:

| Team | Monthly Cost | % of Total | Growth | Top Index |
|------|-------------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | $4,200 | 33.6% | ↑ +8% | logs-frontend-* |
| **Backend** | $3,100 | 24.8% | ↑ +3% | logs-api-* |
| **Platform** | $2,800 | 22.4% | ↑ +12% | metrics-* |
| **Data Science** | $1,500 | 12.0% | ↓ -5% | ml-models-* |
| **Unattributed** | $900 | 7.2% | — | various |

<Warning>
**High unattributed costs?** This means many indices don't match your attribution rules. Add more rules to categorize all indices.
</Warning>

## Cost anomaly detection

Shardly automatically detects unusual cost patterns:

### Anomaly types

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Spike" icon="arrow-up">
Sudden cost increase (>20% in one day)
</Card>

<Card title="Sustained growth" icon="chart-line">
Gradual increase over multiple days
</Card>

<Card title="New expense" icon="plus">
New indices or teams appearing
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Anomaly alerts

When an anomaly is detected, you'll see:

```
⚠️ Cost Anomaly Detected

Deployment: production-us-east-1
Date: 2024-08-15
Increase: +$420/day (+18.2%)

Root Cause:
  - logs-prod-2024.08.15: +$350 (new index, no ILM)
  - metrics-*: +$70 (traffic spike)

Recommendation: Add ILM policy to logs-prod-* indices
```

<Tip>
Use the AI Copilot to ask "Why did my costs increase?" for detailed analysis of any anomaly.
</Tip>

## Cost forecasting

Project future costs based on historical trends:

### Forecast models

- **Linear projection**: Simple growth rate extrapolation
- **Seasonal**: Accounts for weekday/weekend patterns
- **Historical average**: Based on past 90 days

### Forecast accuracy

<Info>
Forecasts include confidence intervals (±10%, ±20%). Accuracy improves with more historical data (90+ days recommended).
</Info>

## Export and reporting

Generate cost reports for stakeholders:

### Export formats

<Tabs>
<Tab title="CSV">
Download raw cost data for analysis in Excel or Google Sheets.
</Tab>

<Tab title="PDF">

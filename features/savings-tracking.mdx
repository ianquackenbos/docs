title: Savings Tracking
description: "Prove ROI with verified savings and reporting"
---

## Overview

Shardly doesn't just suggest optimizations—it **proves they worked**. The savings tracking feature monitors costs after implementation to verify actual savings and provide ROI proof for stakeholders.

<Tip>
**Prove value to leadership:** Automatic savings verification gives you hard numbers to show executives and finance teams - not estimates, but verified results.
</Tip>

## How savings tracking works

<Steps>
<Step title="Day 0: Capture baseline">
When you apply a recommendation, Shardly captures:
- Current deployment costs
- Affected indices costs
- Storage sizes and shard counts
- Tier distribution

This baseline becomes the "before" snapshot for comparison.
</Step>

<Step title="Days 1-7: Monitor costs">
Shardly tracks costs daily during the measurement period:
- Collects cost data hourly
- Accounts for normal day-to-day variation
- Monitors for any regression or issues
- Tracks affected indices specifically

<Info>
The 7-day window accounts for weekday/weekend usage patterns and ensures accurate measurements.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Day 7: Calculate savings">
After 7 days, Shardly calculates actual savings:

```
Baseline Cost  = Average daily cost (days -3 to 0)
Current Cost   = Average daily cost (days 4 to 7)
Daily Savings  = Baseline - Current
Monthly Savings = Daily Savings × 30
```

<Check>
Savings are now verified and displayed in your dashboard
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Ongoing: Continued monitoring">
Shardly continues tracking for 30 days to:
- Detect cost regression
- Ensure savings persist
- Update confidence scores
- Alert on unexpected changes
</Step>
</Steps>

## Verified savings metrics

### What gets tracked

Every tracked change records comprehensive before/after metrics:

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Daily cost** | $418.67 | $392.34 | -$26.33 (-6.3%) |
| **Monthly cost** (projected) | $12,500 | $11,720 | **-$780** |
| **Affected index size** | 2.1 TB | 2.1 TB | 0% |
| **Shard count** | 150 | 150 | unchanged |
| **Tier distribution** | 100% hot | 70% hot, 30% warm | optimized |

### Confidence score

Shardly assigns a confidence score (0-100%) to indicate measurement reliability:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
<Card title="90-100%" icon="check-double">
**Excellent**

High confidence, stable data, reliable savings
</Card>

<Card title="70-89%" icon="check">
**Good**

Good confidence, some variation, trustworthy
</Card>

<Card title="50-69%" icon="circle-half-stroke">
**Moderate**

Moderate confidence, noisy data, needs review
</Card>

<Card title="<50%" icon="circle-xmark">
**Low**

Low confidence, unstable, extend measurement
</Card>
</CardGroup>

#### Factors affecting confidence

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Data stability" icon="wave-square">
Lower cost variation = higher confidence. If costs fluctuate wildly day-to-day, confidence decreases.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Measurement period" icon="calendar">
Longer measurement periods increase confidence. 7 days is minimum; 30 days is optimal.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="External factors" icon="cloud">
Traffic spikes, data growth, or other changes during measurement reduce confidence.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Implementation quality" icon="wrench">
Clean implementations without issues or rollbacks have higher confidence.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Savings vs estimate comparison

Compare actual savings to the original recommendation estimate:

```
💰 Savings Verification Results

Estimated Monthly Savings: $780
Actual Monthly Savings:    $823
Variance:                  +5.5% ✓

Status: Exceeded Estimate
Confidence: 94% (Excellent)
```

<Tip>
**Most savings exceed estimates!** Shardly's conservative estimation methodology means actual savings typically beat projections by 5-10%.
</Tip>

### Savings by category

See which optimization types deliver the best results:

| Optimization Type | Count | Total Savings | Avg per Rec | Success Rate |
|-------------------|-------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| **ILM Policies** | 8 | $18,240 | $2,280 | 100% |
| **Tier Migration** | 6 | $12,480 | $2,080 | 100% |
| **Replica Reduction** | 5 | $8,900 | $1,780 | 100% |
| **Shard Optimization** | 3 | $5,460 | $1,820 | 100% |
| **Node Downsizing** | 1 | $2,200 | $2,200 | 100% |

<Info>
**ILM policies consistently deliver the highest savings** because they automate tier migration and data lifecycle management.

## ROI reporting

Generate ROI reports for stakeholders:

### Executive summary report

Perfect for board presentations or finance reviews:

```markdown
## Elasticsearch Optimization ROI Report
**Period:** January - August 2024

### Key Metrics
- **Total Annual Savings:** $47,280
- **Implementation Cost:** $0 (auto-apply)
- **Time Invested:** ~12 hours (review & approval)

### What triggers alerts

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Cost increase" icon="arrow-trend-up">
Costs return to or exceed baseline after savings period
</Card>

<Card title="Configuration drift" icon="gears">
Changes made that reverse the optimization
</Card>

<Card title="Data growth" icon="database">
New data negates the optimization's impact
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Regression notification

```
⚠️ Savings Regression Detected

Recommendation #47: ILM Policy for logs-prod-*
Implemented: 2024-07-01
Verified Savings: $780/month (confidence: 94%)

Issue: Costs increased by $420 in past week
Cause: New indices created without ILM policy

Action Required: Apply ILM to new indices:
  - logs-prod-2024.08.10
  - logs-prod-2024.08.11
  - logs-prod-2024.08.12
```

<Tip>
Enable Slack or email notifications for regression alerts to address issues immediately.
</Tip>

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Wait for verification" icon="hourglass">
Don't implement multiple optimizations simultaneously. Wait 7 days between implementations for accurate savings attribution.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Share wins with stakeholders" icon="bullhorn">
Use the ROI report generator monthly to showcase value to leadership and finance teams.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Track by team" icon="users">
Use cost attribution to show each team their optimization impact and build optimization culture.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Monitor for regression" icon="bell">
Set up alerts for savings regression so you can address issues before they negate your optimizations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use confidence scores" icon="gauge-high">
Only report savings with >70% confidence to stakeholders. Lower confidence needs more data.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API access

# Get savings for specific recommendation
curl -X GET "https://api.shardly.io/api/v1/recommendations/rec-123/savings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.shardly.io/api/v1/savings",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}"}
)

savings_data = response.json()
total_savings = sum(s["actual_monthly_savings"] for s in savings_data)
print(f"Total verified savings: ${total_savings:,.0f}/month")

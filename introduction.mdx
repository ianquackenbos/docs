## What is Shardly?

Shardly is a comprehensive **FinOps platform for Elasticsearch and Elastic Cloud** that helps you understand, optimize, and reduce your Elasticsearch costs. Unlike Elastic's native AutoOps which only provides suggestions, Shardly goes further by **automatically applying optimizations** with built-in safety checks and rollback capabilities.

<Tip>
**Key differentiator**: Shardly is the only tool that can automatically execute Elasticsearch optimizations. Elastic AutoOps and other tools only suggest changes - you still have to apply them manually.
</Tip>

## Why Shardly?

### The problem you're facing

If you're running Elasticsearch, you've likely experienced these challenges:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="No index-level visibility" icon="eye-slash">
Elastic Cloud billing shows total deployment costs, but you can't see which indices are driving expenses. Is it your logs? Metrics? Application data? You're left guessing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Manual optimization is time-consuming" icon="clock">
Elastic AutoOps suggests changes, but you still have to:
1. Open Kibana Dev Tools
2. Copy and paste commands
3. Manually execute each one
4. Hope you didn't make a mistake

For organizations with dozens of deployments, this becomes a full-time job.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Limited data retention" icon="database">
AutoOps only retains 10 days of historical data. You can't see cost trends, track savings over time, or prove ROI to stakeholders.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No programmatic access" icon="code">
Elastic AutoOps has no API. You can't automate optimization, integrate with CI/CD, or build custom workflows.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How Shardly solves this

Shardly addresses all these challenges:

| Challenge | Elastic AutoOps | Shardly |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Index-level costs | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cost attribution by team | ❌ | ✅ |
| Automatic optimization | ❌ | ✅ |
| Data retention | 10 days | 12+ months |
| Savings verification | Limited | ✅ |
| API access | ❌ | ✅ |

## Key Features

### 📊 Cost analysis

Get index-level visibility into your Elasticsearch spending:

- **Real-time cost breakdowns** by index, tier, team, and project
- **Historical trend analysis** with automatic anomaly detection
- **Cost forecasting** based on growth patterns and usage trends
- **Index pattern grouping** to see aggregate costs for related indices

<Note>
Shardly calculates index-level costs using a proprietary allocation model that considers storage, compute, and tier-specific pricing.
</Note>

### 💡 Intelligent recommendations

Six optimization detectors continuously analyze your clusters to identify savings opportunities:

1. **Shard count optimization** - Right-size shard counts based on index size and query load
2. **Oversized shard detection** - Identify and split shards exceeding optimal size
3. **Missing ILM policies** - Implement data lifecycle management to reduce costs
4. **Tier optimization** - Move older data to cheaper storage tiers
5. **Over-replication** - Reduce excess replicas where high availability isn't critical
6. **Underutilized nodes** - Identify opportunities to downsize infrastructure

Each recommendation includes:
- Estimated monthly savings
- Step-by-step runbook
- Risk assessment
- Effort estimate

### ⚡ One-click auto-apply

<Tip>
**This is Shardly's killer feature**: Unlike any other tool, Shardly can automatically apply recommendations directly to your cluster.
</Tip>

The auto-apply process includes:

- **Pre-flight validation** - Checks cluster health, disk space, and conflicts before execution
- **Real-time progress tracking** - Watch each step execute with live status updates
- **Before/after snapshots** - Captures cluster state for verification and rollback
- **One-click rollback** - Revert changes if something goes wrong
- **Audit trail** - Complete history of who applied what and when

### 🤖 AI Copilot

Ask questions about your costs and optimizations in natural language:

- *"Why did my costs increase this month?"*
- *"How can I save money on my logs indices?"*
- *"Explain this ILM recommendation"*
- *"What's the risk of reducing replicas on prod-metrics-2024?"*

The AI Copilot is powered by Claude Sonnet 4 and has full context about your deployments, costs, and recommendations.
